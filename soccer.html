            <p>When asked, “What is the best sport in the world?” the answer is no doubt soccer.</p>
            <p>Not only has it been around a lot longer than Hockey, but it’s played in a lot more regions too.</p>
            <p>Notice how limited the sport is and only played in certain regions.</p>
            <p>Soccer is also a lot more easier to play. With less rules and hassles and only one objective: get the ball into the net </p>

            <p>All you need is a ball, and sometimes you don’t even need a ball</p>
            <p>A plastic bottle can do the job just fine.</p>
            <p>Over the years different types of games have been created that revolve around soccer</p>
            <p>because of just how versatile the sport is, and different skill moves allowing players to showcase how creative they can get.</p>
